# Mutation Testing Improvement Plan for tools.rs

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the remaining 58 missed mutations in `src/tools.rs` to achieve 95%+ mutation testing coverage. The current state shows 186 caught, 58 missed, and 30 unviable mutations (76% catch rate). This plan outlines a phased approach using integration tests to catch these remaining mutations.

## Current State Analysis

### Coverage Statistics
- **Total mutations**: 274
- **Caught**: 186 (68%)
- **Missed**: 58 (21%)
- **Unviable**: 30 (11%)
- **Catch rate**: 76% (186/244 viable)

### Missed Mutations by Category

#### Priority 1: Critical Business Logic (22 mutations)
Pagination calculations that affect data retrieval correctness.

#### Priority 2: Streaming Logic (16 mutations)
Stream parsing and filtering operations affecting memory optimization.

#### Priority 3: Validation & Response Building (11 mutations)
Input validation and response formatting.

#### Priority 4: Edge Cases (9 mutations)
Error handling and boundary conditions.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Business Logic Tests (Week 1)
**Target: 22 mutations | Expected Coverage Gain: +9%**

#### Test: Pagination Arithmetic Mutations
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_pagination_arithmetic_mutations() {
    // Tests for lines 158-161 division mutations
    // Validates correct page calculation with various total/limit combinations
    // Catches: / → *, / → %, ceil() removal
}
```

#### Test: Comparison Operator Mutations
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_comparison_operator_mutations() {
    // Tests for lines 196-199 comparison mutations
    // Validates filtering logic with boundary conditions
    // Catches: > → >=, < → <=, == → !=
}
```

#### Test: Assignment Operator Mutations
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_assignment_operator_mutations() {
    // Tests for lines 317-319 assignment mutations
    // Validates accumulation and update operations
    // Catches: += → -=, += → *=, -= → +=
}
```

### Phase 2: Streaming Logic Tests (Week 2)
**Target: 16 mutations | Expected Coverage Gain: +7%**

#### Test: Stream Parse and Filter Integration
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_stream_parse_filter_integration() {
    // End-to-end streaming with real JSON data
    // Tests actual execution paths during mutation
    // Validates memory-efficient processing
}
```

#### Test: Filter Predicate Mutations
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_filter_predicate_mutations() {
    // Tests complex filter combinations
    // Validates logical operators in filtering
    // Catches: && → ||, ! removal, condition inversions
}
```

### Phase 3: Validation and Edge Cases (Week 3)
**Target: 20 mutations | Expected Coverage Gain: +8%**

#### Test: UpdatePieTool Validation
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_update_pie_validation_mutations() {
    // Tests all validation branches
    // Validates weight calculations and constraints
    // Catches: function replacement, early returns
}
```

#### Test: Error Response Building
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_error_response_mutations() {
    // Tests error message construction
    // Validates proper error propagation
    // Catches: format string mutations, error type changes
}
```

## Detailed Mutation Analysis

### Lines 158-161: Pagination Calculation
```rust
// Current code
let total_pages = (total_items as f64 / limit as f64).ceil() as u32;

// Mutations to catch:
// - Division to multiplication: (total * limit)
// - Division to modulo: (total % limit)
// - Ceil removal: no rounding
// - Cast changes: as u32 → as i32
```

### Lines 196-199: Comparison Operations
```rust
// Current code
if current_page > total_pages { /* ... */ }

// Mutations to catch:
// - Greater than to greater than or equal
// - Boundary condition changes
// - Logical operator inversions
```

### Lines 317-319: Update Operations
```rust
// Current code
total_weight += weight;

// Mutations to catch:
// - Addition to subtraction
// - Addition to multiplication
// - Assignment operator changes
```

## Testing Infrastructure Requirements

### 1. Test Utilities Module
Create `tests/common/mod.rs` with:
- Mock HTTP server setup
- Test data generators
- Response builders
- Assertion helpers

### 2. Integration Test Structure
```
tests/
├── common/
│   ├── mod.rs
│   ├── mock_server.rs
│   └── test_data.rs
├── mutation_integration_tests.rs
├── pagination_tests.rs
├── streaming_tests.rs
└── validation_tests.rs
```

### 3. Test Data Requirements
- Large dataset (10,000+ instruments) for pagination
- Edge case data (empty, single item, exactly limit items)
- Malformed JSON for error handling
- Various filter combinations

## Success Metrics

### Target Coverage
- **Overall**: 95%+ catch rate
- **Phase 1**: 85% catch rate
- **Phase 2**: 90% catch rate
- **Phase 3**: 95%+ catch rate

### Quality Indicators
- All critical business logic mutations caught
- Zero false positives in mutation testing
- Test execution time < 60 seconds
- Memory usage optimized (streaming tests validate efficiency)

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges
1. **Test Flakiness**: Use deterministic test data
2. **Timeout Issues**: Optimize test setup/teardown
3. **Complex Mutations**: Break down into smaller test cases
4. **CI/CD Impact**: Run mutation tests in parallel

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement retry logic for network-dependent tests
- Use test fixtures for consistent data
- Profile and optimize slow tests
- Create mutation testing CI pipeline

## Implementation Notes

1. Each test should be self-contained and not rely on external state
2. Use property-based testing where applicable for edge cases
3. Ensure tests are deterministic and reproducible
4. Document why each test catches specific mutations
5. Optimize for both correctness and performance
